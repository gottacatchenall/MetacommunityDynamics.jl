MetacommunityDynamics.jl is a package for generalizable simulation of population and
community dynamics, both local and on spatial graphs. The package includes many
'classic' models from population, community, metapopulation, and metacommunity
ecology, but enables extension by allowing users to define custom models. 


MetacommunityDynamics is built on DifferentialEquations.jl, a state-of-the-art library for
both ordinary and stochastic differential equations. 

Platform for SciML in population and community ecology. 

> **Warning**
> The MetacommunityDynamics.jl package is currently under development. The API is not expected to change a lot, but it may change in order to facilitate the integration of new features. Not all functionality is guaranteed to function until the first production release.
