    Scale

Abstract type that is a supertype for all model scales: [`Population`],
[`Metapopulation`], [`Community`], and [`Metacommunity`]. A
model's scale is what it was _orginally_ defined as. For example,
[`TrophicLotkaVolterra`] is a [`Community`] model, regardless of
whether is has been convert to run on a spatial-graph via [`spatialize`].

    Population

The population scale refers to models that describe the population dynamics of a
single species at a single local location.

    Measurement

The Measurement abstract type is a supertype for the different types of
_measurements_ a model describes, primarily [`Biomass`]: a continuous
value representing relative amount of mass per species, [`Abundance`]: an
integer valued count of individuals, and [`Occupancy`]: a binary value of
whether is species is present at a location at a given time.
