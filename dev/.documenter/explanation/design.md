This document is for advanced users interested in contributing new models or building complicated custom models in `MetacommunityDynamics.jl`.

## The type system {#The-type-system}

While MetacommunityDynamics enables simulation of dynamics in a single place (_locally_), its main goal is to enable reaction-diffusion models on spatial graphs. Similarly, although MetacommunityDynamics is perfectly adaquete for simulating the dynamics of single-species systems, the _core design goals_ are motivated by an interest in simulating communities on spatial graphs, where environmental variation across each patch/node in the graph influences the dynamics at that node/patch, with a particular emphasis on understanding how different parameterizations of models causes regime shifts in resulting species  compositions across space, across different levels of neutral, niche, and dispersal proccesses.

What are the essential things you need to build a simulation model that meets this criteria?
1. We need a way to represent different types of _models_ (e.g. Lotka-Volterra, Rosenzweig-MacArthur, etc). 
  
2. A _spatial graph_, consisting of a set of nodes/patches connected by dispersal, that also can represent environmental information associated with each patch. 
  
3. A _species pool_ with _traits_, which are an arbitrary set of named values that correspond to each species in the species pool.  
  
4. The _niche_, where the combination of the local (named!) environmental conditions at a patch and other species present shifts the parameters of the dynamics at that patch.
  
5. A model of _diffusion_. We take a dispersal kernel and normalize its value across each (source-&gt;target) pair of patches to create a _dispersal potential_, which is a distribution for each (source-&gt;target pair).
  

Note that all are interconnected and must interface with one another to achieve our overall goal:
- the model&#39;s parameters must match species pool size and number of spatial sites  (1-&gt;2, 1-&gt;3)
  
- the spatial graph must provide environmental data for the niche (2 -&gt; 4)
  
- the species pool must provide traits for the niche (3-&gt;4)
  
- the niche must provide parameters for the spatial version of the model based on the species pool and (spatial graph w/ environment) (2-&gt;1, 4-&gt;1)
  
- both the species and environment must provide named parameters to the niche (2-&gt;4,3-&gt;4)
  

### Models {#Models}

The first element of the type system is distinguishing different properties of different `Model`s. In EcoDynamics.jl, `Model` is the abstract type under which all concrete model definitions are subtyped. Specifically, `Model` is defined as a _parameteric_ abstract type where stores information about the important meta-properties about models. 

`abstract type Model{SC<:Scale,M<:Measurement,SP<:Spatialness,D<:Discreteness} end` 

Specifically there are four different important properties which `Model` stores (in Julia development, this design pattern is called using &#39;traits&#39;, although we refrain from using that terminology in this documentation to avoid confusion with `Trait`s as the type of information that describes properties about species).

These four properties are `Scale`, `Measurement`, `Spatialness`, and `Discreteness`. Each of these are defined as abstract types, and the different values they can take on are defined as abstract types that are subtypes of the category they correspond to.
1. `Scale` refers to the organizational scale a model is _originally_ designed, with the options being `Population`, `Community`, `Metapopulation`, and `Metacommunity`. Note that a model being at the `Population` or `Community` scale doesn&#39;t preclude it from being turned into reaction-diffusion models on spatial graphs, however `Metapopulation` and `Metacommunity` models are such that they have no corresponding local version (think Hanksi&#39;s metapopulation model).  
  
2. `Measurement` refers to the type of information that is changing over time in a given model. There options here are (1) `Occupancy`, which indicates binary presence/absence state, (2) `Abundance`, where each state is a non-negative integer representing the count of individuals and (3) `Biomass`, where each state is a non-negative real number indicating some relative measure of biomass.  
  
3. `Discreteness` refers to whether a model is defined in `Continuous` or `Discrete` time.
  
4. `Spatialness` refers to whether a constructed model is only occuring at a single location (`Local`), or whether the model is constructed across a spatial graph (`Spatial`). This type-parameter is distinct because it can change. The method `spatialize` transforms a `Local` model into spatial models. 
  

### Spatial graphs {#Spatial-graphs}

The `SpatialGraph` type contains information about the coordinates of each patch/node, as well as environmental covariates at each site. Environmental covariates are stored in a dictionary where the key is the name of the variable, and the value is a vector of values corresponds to each node in the spatial graph. 

### Species Pool {#Species-Pool}

The `SpeciesPool` type contains a list of species names (as `String`s or `Symbol`s), and more importantly a dictionary of named trait values. The trait values are important as they are one of two inputs to a `Niche`, which enables variation in model parameters across space as a function of  enviornmental conditions.

### Niches {#Niches}
- Provide a default niche function for each model, but enable it to be written custom. This enables environment-contigent interaction strengths, etc. 
  
- Generally, the default niche will modify the growth rates in a model by a a function of the distance between a single dimensional environmental variable and a species trait, e.g. adjusting $R_0$ in the SIR model  
  

## Dispatch patterns {#Dispatch-patterns}
- What is the lifespan of building and running a model?
  
- Maybe there is a figure for the paper here, flowchart of what is the next method you run based on what you are trying to do?
  

## QA Methods for Included Models {#QA-Methods-for-Included-Models}

One main design goal of `MetacommunityDynamics.jl` is to ensure it is as easy as possible to write customs models. &quot;Easy&quot;, in this sense, means both involving writing the fewest lines of code possible, and not requiring a deep understanding of Julia or its type system. 

This means that the instructions on how to add custom models (see TBD docs section) doesn&#39;t include some of the extra methods added to included models to avoid possible mistakes. e.g.:
- Warnings about parameter values that are extreme or nonsensical (providing an intrinsic growth rate to a predator in a LV model, say)
  
- Warnings about whether a niche function leads toward &quot;crucial&quot; parameters going to 0/unreasonable values at most sites depending on the range of environmnetal variables provided in the SpatialGraph
