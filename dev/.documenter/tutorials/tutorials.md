1. Running Dynamics
  
- The logistic map. 
  
- The `model`, `Problem`, `simulate` API
  
- Customization
  

Meant to be a guide to up to the spatialize API, but only consider results up to aggregated across all sites. For differences in sites, see tutorial tbd.  
1. Consumer-Resource Models
  
- Basic LV
  
- Custom functional response
  
- YodzisInnes and trait models
  
- Many species models
  
- Putting it all together
  
1. Dispersal 
  
- Spatial Graphs
  
- Environmental Covariates
  
- Dispersal Kernels and Potentials
  
- Diffusion
  
1. Adding Stochaticity
  
- note refering to reference section on how EcoDynamics treats discrete-time determ/stoch models the same 
  

Build up to Gaussian drift to LV many species system on a SG
1. Letting the environment influence species interactions 
  
- Assumes previous tutorials
  
- strong env gradient from NL.jl
  
1. Single-species occupancy models
  
2. Multi-species occupancy models
  
- Simulated niche-space, set up generative model used for inference later 
  
1. Inference
  
- Bayes integration tutorial
